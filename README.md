The main method calls the timereturn() method with different percentages of expected zeroes in the matrix and vector (100, 10, 1, 0.1, 1/log(n), 1/n^2, 1/e^n)
it prints the time and then the percent of zeros that were asked and the actual percent of zeros
matrix vector multiplication is just matrix vector multiplication
